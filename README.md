Leslie Matrix
Leslie matrix models were used to project a population and to describe a more realistic herd, through the information about survival rates of different age classes, 
population growth predictions, and parameters estimations for different scenarios. 
The matrix elements were age specific survival rates on diagonal (SV) and age specific probability of producing female calf(FF) on the top row.
